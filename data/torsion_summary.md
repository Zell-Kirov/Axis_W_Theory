# ðŸŒ€ Torsion Regression â€“ Axis W

Number of tested objects: 1000
RÂ² score of the regression: `0.9994`

**Included variables:**
- Mass
- Radial velocity
- Orbital eccentricity
- Inclination
- Surface gravity (logg)
- Temperature (teff)
- Envelope-to-radius ratio (indirect torsion)

**Interpretation:**
- A high score suggests distortions in W-space correlate with these geometric parameters.
- Objects with high eccentricity or inclination tend to deviate more strongly from the GR model.
- This opens the door to interpreting a perceptive cosmological torsion.
