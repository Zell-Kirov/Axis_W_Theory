# Axis_W Linear Regression Summary

Linear model fitted on 20 simulated entities:

**Estimated Equation:**

`Perceived time ≈ 0.0278 × velocity + -0.000005 × mass + 0.0125`

**Coefficients:**

- Velocity: `0.0278`
- Mass: `-0.000005`
- Intercept: `0.0125`

**Quick interpretation:**
- Velocity increases perceived time in Axis_W
- Mass (i.e., gravity) decreases it
- The model is linear, with no interaction effects
