# Summary of Enriched Axis_W Regression

Model fitted with quadratic effect:

**Estimated Equation:**

`Time ≈ 0.0278 × velocity + -0.000074 × mass + 0.000000007 × mass² + 0.0346`

**Variables used:**
- Velocity
- Mass
- Mass² (non-linear effect)

**Residual Analysis:**
- Plot saved in `data/axisw_residuals_plot.png`
- If residuals are centered around zero → coherent model
- If errors increase or decrease with mass → presence of real non-linear effect
