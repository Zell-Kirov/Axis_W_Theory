# 🌀 Impact of Variable Cosmic Torsion (linear model)

**Model used:**
`ω_W = 0.002·eccentricity + 0.005·inclination`

📊 R² score without ω_W: `0.9998`
📊 R² score with ω_W: `0.9999`
🔍 Improvement brought by ω_W: `0.0001`

**Analysis:**
- Adding linear ω_W does not bring significant improvement.
- The perceptual influence could be more subtle or contextual.
- See `omegaW_variable_vs_residuals_plot.png` for residuals structure.
