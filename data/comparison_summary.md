# Comparison: Axis_W vs Gaia Universe Model

Number of stars analyzed: 1000

**Simulated Axis_W Time Statistics:**

- Mean time: `-0.000198`
- Max time: `0.004010`
- Min time: `-0.005447`

**Cosmological Notes:**
- Stellar mass strongly influences the simulated perceived time.
- Extreme radial velocities cause pronounced time distortions.
- This model opens the path to a temporal mapping of the Milky Way according to Axis_W.
