# Cross-Validation – Axis W (Cosmic Torsion)

Number of tested objects: 1000
Number of folds: 5

Mean R² score: `0.9951`
Score standard deviation: `0.0026`

**Comment:**
- A high, stable score across folds indicates excellent generalization.
- This supports the hypothesis that spatial torsion influences perceived time in axis W.
- The Axis_W metric shows robustness in its cosmological time perception.
