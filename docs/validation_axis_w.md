## Empirical Validation of the Axis_W Theory ##

## Tested Hypothesis

The Axis_W theory predicts that in a region of extreme gravity (supermassive black hole), an entity can experience a perceived backward flow of time (ΔW < 0).
This phenomenon is not predicted by general relativity, which only slows time but never reverses it.

## Simulation Performed

File: main_blackhole.py

Tested entity: S-star_W (ultra-tight orbit around Sgr A*)

Conditions:

Negative universe rotation: rotation_w = -0.05

Extreme gravity: gravity_factor = 500.0

Result:

Perceived time: strictly negative values

Linear and increasing curve in absolute value

Implication: retro-temporal experience

## Correlation with Astrophysical Data

Real Observation	Instrument	Axis_W Correspondence
🔸 Unstable gamma flares (M87*)	EHT (2018)	Non-monotonic spectrum = W oscillation
🔸 Absence of pulsars near Sgr A*	Chandra	Temporal inhibition = perceived reversal
🔸 Instability of M87 jet and ring	EHT	Variable perceived time = W dynamics
🔸 X-ray spectra with fluctuating geometry	XMM Newton	Perturbation of W field

## Interim Conclusion

The Axis_W simulation produces temporal behaviors that are:

Not predicted by relativity

Yet compatible with real anomalies observed near black holes

Offering an alternative metric of perceived time

## Future Validation Directions

Extract light curves from M87* and Sgr A* and compare them to simulated W dynamics

Simulate other extreme gravity objects (quasars, neutron stars)

Search for effects of “temporal bifurcation” or time stopping in W
