## Axis_W Hypothesis


In the Axis_W engine, perceived time is modeled as a displacement along a W dimension. When this displacement becomes negative (inversion in W), an entity experiences temporal reversal.

Around a supermassive black hole (e.g., Sgr A*, M87), extreme gravity and local universe rotation can cause oscillation or inversion of the displacement in W, resulting in perceived backward time.

🧬 Prediction: Objects or emissions near the event horizon should show temporal irregularities not predicted by relativity — such as unstable spectra, gamma-ray bursts, or reversed pulsations.

## Astrophysical Targets and Instruments
Target	Instruments / Sources
🔸 Sgr A* (Milky Way center)	ESO (S-stars), Chandra, EHT
🔸 M87* (elliptical galaxy)	Event Horizon Telescope
🔸 Active AGNs and quasars	XMM Newton, Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope

## Data types:

Light curves

Gamma/X-ray spectra

Orbits of nearby stars

Non-monotonic variable redshifts

## Comparison with Relativity
Simulated Effect	            Relativity Model	        Axis_W Model
Time dilation	                ✔️ (slowing down)	            ✔️
Time reversal	                ❌ (impossible)	        ✔️ (inversion if ΔW < 0)
Temporal oscillations	        ❌ (not predicted)	    ✔️ (possible in W dynamics)
Unstable redshift	            ❌ (anomaly)	            ✔️ (derived from motion in W)
