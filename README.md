## Axis_W: Time as Displacement

“What if time was just a forgotten axis, a trace of our drift through a hidden dimension?” — Gwen

## Foundational Hypothesis

Axis_W is a theoretical and computational exploration of a provocative idea:
Time is not an entity of its own, but a measure of movement along a fourth dimension W, orthogonal to the spatial axes X, Y, and Z.
In this vision, what we perceive as “the passage of time” is in fact the sliding of our universe through W, at a velocity modulated by factors such as gravity, rotation, or relative speed.

## Project Goals

Simulate a 4D universe (X, Y, Z, W) to visualize time as displacement.

Explore the physical and cosmological implications of this hypothesis:

Time dilation as a consequence of movement in W.

Galactic anomalies interpreted as precessions in W.

Multidimensional rotation of the universe, including around the W axis.

Rethink physical laws using an extended metric that includes W.

Provide an accessible, modular, and open framework for experimentation.
